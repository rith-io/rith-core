Best Practices
--------------
When working with Python applications, it's always advisable to work within
the constraints of a Virtual Environment.

Arithemtic and the `rith` tools require Python 3+. To create a virtual environment
that uses Python 3 execute the following command in your project directory.

.. code:: 

  virtualenv -p python3 venv
      
Start Your Virtual Environment

.. code::
  
  source venv/bin/activate
